# Voltage_Stability_Assessment_in_Real_Time
Modelled and simulated a custom 4-bus system, IEEE 14-bus system, and NE39-bus system using PSCad and Simulink,
focusing on transmission line behaviour, system stability, and fault analysis.
Developed Voltage Collapse Index (VCI) calculations and Time to Collapse (TTC) estimation methods to predict and
enhance smart grid stability under dynamic operating conditions.
